WARNING: This is very experimental use at your own risk

This is a program i used in School to copy all my google docs documents and convert them to pdf

To get started you must get a client id and a client secret. You will get them here [credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Then paste your credentials into the json. Then in the "program.cs" line 41 change the query from "title=\"Skole\"" to the name of the desired folder. Then build and run the program. Good Luck
